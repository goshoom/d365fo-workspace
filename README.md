# d365fo-workspace
Scripts to work with source control workspaces for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.

Use them as an inspiration for your own scripts. They don't have ambitions to cover all possible use cases and workflows.

## Installation
The scripts are wrapped in a module that you can install with `Import-Module` and a path to *D365FOWorkspace.psm1* file. 
```powershell
Import-Module c:\PathToTheModule\D365FOWorkspace.psm1
```
